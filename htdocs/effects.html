          <p>The pandemic has caused death, poverty, and a drop in global GDP. There have been many effects of 
            COVID-19 on the world, and it's up to us to stop its spread. In addition, COVID-19 has caused a drop 
            in global GDP, which has resulted in poverty. We must help each other to cease this pandemic.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many countries in the world have been impacted by COVID-19, including, India where it has killed more 
            than 3 million people. Many other countries, such as China and Indonesia, are still struggling with the 
            economic side effects of this disease. The impacts of COVID-19 aren't just economically— they're social 
            too. There's been an increase in suicides due to psychological consequences such as shame after 
            contracting this disease. Suicides are occurring at a rate of 10% in some areas. This means that there 
            will be more people for the pandemic to affect. Suicide rates are increasing as unemployment has 
            increased and poverty has increased.
            <br>
            <br>
            The disease has been spreading at an alarming rate, which can't be compared to something like AIDS from 
            20 years ago. It's a terrible virus that threatens civilization and will spread if there isn't global 
            action soon. Since it's spreading so quickly, it's significant that we do everything in our power to stop 
            the spread of COVID-19, or we'll have no chance of survival as a human race.
            <br>
            <br>
            COVID-19, like AIDS, decreased global GDP as well. From 2007 to 2012, global GDP dropped by 9%. This is 
            due to more than 90% of the workforce being affected by this disease. There have been more than 50 
            countries affected by COVID-19 where a worker is in the US labor force, and each country has a worker 
            suffering from this awful disease. This means that about half of the world's workers have been impacted 
            by COVID-19. Due to this fact, we estimate that there's been a GDP drop of roughly $3 trillion worldwide 
            (9% divided by 2). People are losing money every day due to this pandemic disease.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, we must follow health protocols to reduce the dangers around us. Our cities are dangerous 
            because many people are trying to survive in them, due to the increasing poverty rates. Cities provide 
            a very high population density, which allows this disease to spread quickly. As cities become more crowded, 
            they can become a haven for disease carriers. We need to be careful with the outbreaks of the disease. We 
            can't let it spread to our communities. We've seen how dangerous it is when it spreads, and if we don't 
            end it soon, it'll be too late for all of us.
