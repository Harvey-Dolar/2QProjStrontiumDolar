            <div class="var-meaning-content">
              <p>In the medical field, a variant is described as a change in the DNA sequence of a cell. 
                Variants are a mutation of a cell's genetic code.  Some of the variants may cause a new 
                cell or tissue type. Many variants have been found in people. The changes in their code 
                can increase the virus' lifespan, transmissibility, resistance to medicines, the severity 
                of disease, etc. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of 
                the USA, there are more than 10 million variants in our genetic code that can be 
                harmful or harmless.
                <br>
                <br>
                The majority of harmless mutations may increase one's risk of developing a particular 
                disease, while the effects of harmful mutations are usually worse. For example, a variant 
                can result in changes in proteins that can alter their function and lead to other diseases. 
                Another example is that if the particular gene is related to cancer cells, the variant will 
                increase one's risk for cancer or worsen their cancer prognosis. Studies have revealed 
                that most variants don't cause damage but instead offer new advantages to prevent diseases 
                such as malaria and sickle cell anemia.

                    <h2>Alpha</h2>
                    <p>The Alpha variation (B.1.1.7) is a SARS-CoV-2 variation of concern. It is envisioned to be <b>40â€“80% 
                      more transmissible than the wild-kind SARS-CoV-2</b> (with maximum estimates occupying the center to 
                      better stop of this range). It became first detected in November 2020 from a pattern taken in 
                      September withinside the <b>United Kingdom</b> and started to unfold quickly with the aid of using 
                      mid-December, across the identical time as infections surged. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      A notable mutation of the Alpha variant is the <b>N501Y mutation</b> on the spike protein. It holds to a 
                      person's ACE2 receptors making it more infectious
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      On <b>31 May 2021</b>, the World Health Organization introduced that the Variant of Concern could be labeled 
                      "Alpha" to be used in public communications.</p>

                    <p>The beta variant, also known as (B.1.351), is a variant of SARS-CoV-2. One of 
                      several SARS-CoV-2 variants deemed particularly important was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay 
                      metropolitan area in the Eastern Cape Province of <b>South Africa</b> in October 2020, which was reported by the 
                      Department of the country's health on 18 Dec 2020. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      There are three mutations of particular interest in the peak region of the genome of the lineage B.1.351: 
                      <b>K417N, E484K, and N501Y</b>. <b>E484K might help the virus evade a person's immune system, and it may affect how 
                      vaccines work</b>. Other less common mutations include L18F, D80A, D215G, R246I, A701V.

                      <br>
                      The World Health Organization has labeled the variant a beta variant, <b>not to replace the scientific name</b>, 
                      but as a name that the public can commonly refer to.

                    <p>The Gamma variant (P.1) is one of the variants of SARS-CoV-2. This variant has three common mutations, namely: 
                      <b>N501Y, E484K, and K417T</b>. This SARS-CoV-2 variant was first detected by Japan's National Institute of Infectious 
                      Diseases (NIID) on January 6, 2021, in four people who arrived in <b>Tokyo after visiting Amazonas</b>, Brazil 4 days 
                      earlier. It was later declared in circulation in Brazil. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The World Health Organization labeled the Gamma Variant as <b>P.1 for simplicity</b> and was declared a variant of concern. 
                      Gamma caused a widespread infection in early 2021 in the city of <b>Manaus</b>, the capital of the Amazon.
                      <br>
                      <br> 
                      The Gamma variant includes the two distinct subvariants <b>28-AM-1 and 28-AM-2</b>, which carry the two mutations K417T, 
                      E484K, N501Y, and both developed independently of each other in the same Brazilian Amazon region.

                      <b>India</b> in late 2020. The Delta version became named on 31 May 2021 and had unfolded to over <b>179 international locations 
                      through 22 November 2021</b>. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated in <b>June 2021</b> that the Delta variant is turning

                      <br>
                      This variant has mutations withinside the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These substitutions affect the 
                      transmissibility of the virus on <b>whether or not it can be neutralized through antibodies for formerly circulating variants 
                      of the COVID-19 virus</b>. It is notion to be one of the maximum transmissible respiration viruses regarded. Four of them, 
                      all of that are withinside the virus's spike protein code, are of specific concern, namely: <b>D614G., T478K, L452R, and P681R</b>.

                    <p>The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is a variant of SARS-CoV-2 and was first reported from <b>South Africa</b> on <b>November 24, 2021</b>. Omicron 
                      multiplies <b>70 times faster</b> than the Delta variant, but evidence suggests it is less severe than previous strains, especially compared 
                      to the Delta variant. Overall, the very high prevalence rate, combined with its ability to <b>evade both double vaccination</b> and the 
                      body's immune system, indicates that the total number of patients requiring hospital care at any given time is always a source of concern. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Vaccines continue to protect against serious illness and hospitalization, especially after the administration of the third dose of an 
                      mRNA vaccine. <b>Double vaccination provides 30-40% protection</b> against infection and about 70% against hospitalization. A recent third dose 
                      of the vaccine increases effectiveness against infections to around 75% and 88% for serious illnesses.
